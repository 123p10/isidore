ALWAYS REMOVE WARNINGS
Constant TODOS
    Always ensure no warnings are outputted by g++
    Convert and maintain codebase to follow: https://www.perforce.com/blog/kw/NASA-rules-for-developing-safety-critical-code
    Update Documentation
High Level TODO 
    Syntax Definition
        Redefine for statements for {} syntax
        Implement while statements
        Proper type definition(no inferencing)
        Think about whether we use int main() or compile inline commands
        Change syntax of function definition
        foreach loop
    Workflow/compilation
        Develop production(for user use) compiler framework
        Build proper language source build system(should be quicker and show status)
        Compile to object files
        Debugger
    Data
        Should we add globals?
        Take certain constructs out of expressions, make instructions(if,var,for)
            Then make it so we don't need semicolons for ifs
        Fix variable scopage(vars declared inside ifs should not be accessible after)
        String
        Char
        Arrays
    Error Handling(SO much todo here)
        Proper error handling functions
        Develop verbose error outputs, line numbering, keywords, etc.
    Compile Time
        Improve standard Kaleidiscope JIT
    Documentation
        How to build source
        How to compile files
        How to write Isidore code
        Show outputs of example file
        Define Isidore, purpose of naming and why certain features are the way they are
    Linting
Low Level TODO
    Function/operators(very easy to make but develop a proper way to insert into standard library)
        ++/--
        Review level of precedence
        Add postfix
        !
        /
        *
        *= /=
        ^
        Update docs
    Quick Fixes
        Better storage of getCurrToken()
        Remove semi colons from if statements

    Not so quick Fixes 
        Develop proper handling of semi colons(right now they are checked on a case by case basis)
        If else statement exists we shouldn't need to return at the end
        Short circuit boolean evaluation
        Fix boolean expressions(|| &&)
