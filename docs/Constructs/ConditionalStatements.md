# Conditional Statements
## If/Else
If/Else statements in Isidore are very similar to other languages like C,C++. 

    if(<cond>){
        //If condition is true statement(s)
    }
    else{
        //If condition is not true statement(s)
    }

*Note: The else statement is optional*

Ex.

    if(2 > 1){
        //This will run
    }
    else{
        //This will not run
    }
